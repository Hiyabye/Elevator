# Elevator

A simple elevator algorithm. Here's how it works.
1. First, it asks the user if they want to take the elevator.
1. If the user accepts, it asks again which direction to go.
1. Then, it finds the closest elevator to the user and moves it towards the user.
1. When the user hops in, the program asks the user what floor to go.
1. It goes to that floor and drop the user off.
1. This is repeated all over unless every user doesn't call the elevator, the program will end.

## Installation
This works on Visual Studio Code!
