Elevator
========

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/hiyabye/elevator/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/hiyabye/elevator)

This is a simple elevator algorithm written in C.

## Features
1. First, it asks the user if they want to take the elevator.
2. If the user accepts, it asks again which direction to go.
3. Then, it finds the closest elevator to the user and moves it towards the user.
4. When the user hops in, the program asks the user what floor to go.
5. It goes to that floor and drop the user off.
6. This is repeated all over unless every user doesn't call the elevator, the program will end.

## Plans
- Improving the algorithm of how the elevator works.
- Replace everything with pointers.

## Installation
This works with GCC on Linux.
1. Open terminal.
2. Clone the repository using Git. (https://github.com/Hiyabye/Elevator.git)
3. Go to the directory with the source code in it.
4. Type this in the terminal to compile the source code.
```sh
make
```
5. The program will be generated with a name **app.out**.
In order to launch it type this in the terminal.
```sh
./app.out
```
6. To clean the directory, type this in the terminal.
```sh
make clean
```
