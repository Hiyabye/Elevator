## About
<!-- Information about the project -->
### How it works
 1. First, it asks the person if they want to take the elevator.
 2. If the person accepts, it asks again which direction to go.
 3. Then, it finds the closest elevator to the person and moves it towards them.
 4. When the person gets in, the program asks the person which floor to go.
 5. After getting input again, it goes to that floor and drops the person there.
 6. The instructions above is repeated over and over again.
 7. If every people doesn't call the elevator, the program will end.
